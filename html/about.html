         <p><strong>Mastermind</strong> is a game of logic. The purpose of the game
        is to decipher a four coloured code. Each hidden colour has a position.
        Your job is to find the correct sequence. The hidden code has no
        duplicate colours. You have ten attempts to discover the code. On each
        attempt the computer will tell you if you have a correct colour in the
        correct position with a <strong>green</strong> indicator. If you have a
        correct colour but in the wrong position the computer lets you know with
        a <strong>white</strong> indicator. Blank indicators mean colours you
        chose are not part of the hidden code.
